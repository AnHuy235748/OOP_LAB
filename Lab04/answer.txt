AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) and Swing are both Java libraries for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs), but they have significant differences in architecture, capabilities, and performance.

Key Differences
1. Architecture
AWT: Uses native platform components (heavyweight)

Directly calls the operating system's native GUI components

Components are "heavyweight" (native peer components)

Swing: Implements its own components (lightweight)

Paints its own components using Java 2D

Components are "lightweight" (no native peers)

2. Look and Feel
AWT: Always matches the native platform appearance

Limited customization options

Looks different across platforms

Swing: Pluggable look and feel

Can emulate native look or use Java's Metal look

Consistent appearance across platforms

Customizable themes

3. Component Set
AWT: Basic components (Button, Label, TextField, etc.)

Limited to common components available on all platforms

Swing: Extended component set (JTable, JTree, JTabbedPane, etc.)

More sophisticated components

Can extend and customize components easily

4. Performance
AWT: Generally faster for simple GUIs

Native components are rendered by the OS

Swing: Can be slower for complex GUIs

Pure Java rendering overhead

Performance improved with hardware acceleration

5. Features
AWT:

Limited graphics capabilities

No built-in double buffering

Basic event handling

Swing:

Advanced graphics support

Built-in double buffering

Enhanced event handling

MVC architecture for many components
